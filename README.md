Filming with a Mobile Phone is a [WITNESS](http://witness.org) tip sheet that outlines best practices for filming for human rights documentation on a mobile phone.

The following files are included:

* The English-language version of this document (as a Markdown file, see below).

* A folder called "Languages" containing current translations.

* A folder called "Media" containing an InDesign template, graphics to illustrate the text and a PDF showing our design of these materials. Feel free to use any of these resources to inspire your design.

### OK, What Am I Supposed to Do With This Stuff?

We make these materials available so that anyone can remix, repurpose, translate or localize the information in them to the particular town, region or country where they will be used.

If you do use them, we'd love to hear how. Send us an email at feedback@witness.org.

### What is Markdown and How Do I Open .md Files?

Markdown files allow us to lightly format these documents for display on GitHub. For example, we use it to show headers, bullet points and links. You can open them with any text editor. To view the formatting, we recommend cutting and pasting the copy into [markdownviewer.com[(http://markdownviewer.com). That site also has a guide to creating Markdown of your own. So too [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Where do I Learn How to Use GitHub?

[Understanding Github: A Journey for Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1) is a good place to start. Then try [Think like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/). Finally, check the documentation on GitHub itself.

### Final Notes
We'd really like to hear how these materials are used. Remember to email us at feedback@witness.org.
